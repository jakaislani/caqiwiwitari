Tevin wants the fight, Diaz wants the fight, (Farmer co-promoter) Eddie (Hearn) wants the fight. So do Golden Boy and DAZN,” DiBella said. “It’s a great match of styles. If we can’t make a unification fight, which doesn’t look good, Diaz is our No. 1 choice.</p><p>” Frequently, both fighters have taken shots at one another on Twitter with Farmer explicitly stating that he wants to face Diaz in his next outing”. DiBella added that if that fight gets finalized, it’ll likely be held in November.</p><p>Of late, Farmer (30-4-1, 6 KOs) came off as a dominant performance over Guillaume Frenois this past weekend to retain his world title, while Diaz (29-1, 15 KOs) most recently stopped Freddy Fonseca in May. Diaz has won three straight fights since dropping a unanimous decision to Gary Russell Jr. last year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tevin-farmer-eyes></span><span>Tevin Farmer Eyes</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Farmer has worked through a humongous gash on his left eye after a clash of heads in round two, and swayed the judges.DiBella on Friday afternoon said “Tevin had a CT scan,”&nbsp; and the ex-champ was assessed and monitored to make certain he didn’t suffer a severe head injury versus Diaz, who holds a 31-1 mark.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tevin-farmer-boxing></span><span>Tevin Farmer Boxing</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Farmer began his boxing career when he was 19 years old admitting that in his early career he wasn’t taking boxing seriously enough which lead to some early career losses. However having had no losses on his record since his 12th fight in 2012 he earned his way to a world title shot and in his 31st professional bout in December 2017 he fought Kenichi Ogawa for the IBF super featherweight world title, which he lost at the time but it was later switched to a no-contest due to the fact his opponent had tested positive in a drugs test pre-fight.</p><p>Farmer has gone to Australia in August 2018 to land the title in the backyard of Sydney’s Billy Dib. In August 2018, it was reported that Tevin Farmer had signed a co-promotional deal with Dibella Entertainment and Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom Boxing USA with his first bout being aired on the new sports streaming platform DAZN.</p><p>Tevin Farmer was slated to defend his IBF super featherweight title against Jono Carroll on 15 March 2019. Carroll was shown to be a tough opponent and the fight was close. However, Farmer would win the fight convincingly in all three judges’ scorecards, who scored the fight 117-110,117-111, and 117-111 in favor of the champion.</p><p>Farmer defended his title against former title challenger Joseph Diaz Jr on 30 January 2020. Things had gone badly pretty early for him and after the first round, he announced to his corner that he broke his hand. Diaz Jr took advantage of the situation and outboxed Farmer during most of the fight, earning the unanimous decision victory to win his first world title.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-tevin-farmer></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Tevin Farmer</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-tevin-farmer></span>Who is Tevin Farmer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tevin Farmer is a famous professional boxer who was born and brought up in Baltimore, MD, United States.
