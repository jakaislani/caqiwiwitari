Everything he’s said up until this point about Deadpool 3 has been innocent and fun, and he’s been a good sport about all of it. However, that was before he made a public appearance with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift, Ryan Reynolds, and Hugh Jackman</a> at the Kansas City Chiefs game on Oct. 1. The very mention of Taylor in his interview with Josh Horowitz on the Happy, Sad, Confused podcast didn’t make the respected director crack, per se, but I can almost bet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tek Knight</a> from The Boys would’ve spotted a bead of sweat on his brow at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mention of Dazzler</a>. The good news is that the exhaustive list of potential cameos, whether or not they are true, was apparently <a href=#>easy to assemble</a>.</p><h2 id=h-elizabeth-olsen-might-not-have-a-reason-to-call-kevin-feige-back-after-the-latest-news-on-the-scarlet-witch-s-status data-injectable=false>Elizabeth Olsen might not have a reason to call Kevin Feige back after the latest news on the Scarlet Witch’s status</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Wanda-Maximoff-in-Captain-America-Civil-War.jpg><p data-characters=578 data-current-count=878 data-injectable=true>You saw it happen. I saw it happen. But Wanda’s demise under the collapse of the castle on Mount Wundagore in Doctor Strange 2 was never actually confirmed. Elizabeth Olsen’s comments about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">phoning Kevin up</a> with brilliant suggestions about her character’s return led most people to assume that Wanda isn’t gone for good. Still — no confirmation. At least until now. Marvel’s&nbsp;recently published reference book, Marvel Studios: The Marvel Cinematic Universe — An Official Timeline has made it explicitly clear where Wanda stands on the whole <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dead-or-alive argument</a>.</p><h2 id=h-the-marvels-gains-renewed-interest-thanks-to-a-multiverse-shattering-cameo-rumor data-injectable=false>The Marvels gains renewed interest thanks to a multiverse-shattering cameo rumor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-marvels-brie-larson-captain-marvel-flies-1.jpg><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>If you prefer to live spoiler-free and walk into Marvel movies as squeaky clean as a baby’s bottom, then you should look away now… Yup — Right.

The cameo, if true, would mark the first time in nearly a decade Grammar sat in the makeup chair to become the gifted blue doctor, and it would undoubtedly corroborate the notion that Hugh Jackman is simply the first of many Fox X-Men characters <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clawing his way into the Multiverse Saga</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo5qslajBbrnAq62epF2jsri%2FjJ2cmpygpLyteZJmm6KqlZjBsL6Mn5inq12ptaZ5xaWYpp1dpLNur8CmnKhlo6WypMHLmquip55irrR506GcZqWRp8OmuNJmn56ZpKh6tryMsKCtoF2nwq670axkqJ5dlnqxu9KtZJyqlZm2tXnSnJynnV2ptaLAy6Vkm6SfrHq1tMRmpJytXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
