The number seems to hold a lot of significance for her: her birthday is February 11, and her beloved dog Norman — for whom Aniston got her first tattoo, his name in script on the arch of her foot — died in 2011. While this may be true, it wouldn't necessarily explain the significance for Aniston's bestie and tattoo twin, Andrea Bendewald (pictured above with Aniston).</p><p>Bendewald also appears to be very spiritual, referencing the "New Moon in Aquarius" in her <a href=#>Instagram</a> birthday tribute to Aniston, writing, "Makes sense that the entire Universe would be in alignment with LOVE on your birthday!" Aniston also calls Bendewald her "oldest friend" in a 2019 profile in the <a href=#>New York Times</a>, which said they gather with others regularly for "a goddess circle." <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> takes the idea about the numbers further, saying "double elevens are often referred to as 'angel numbers' in new-agey circles and are considered to be a sign from the universe or guardian angels that you're on the right path."</p><p>But perhaps the strongest meaning behind the tattoos is the fact that the two friends share them. The <a href=#>Mirror</a> calls it "an emblem and celebration of their flourishing friendship," and it's clearly another indication of the love these two hold for each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxpZ4Z4e8mepaehlpq%2Fbq3Noqqtp56oeri%2ByKyrZqyRqcGwu4yer6mkkZ67prCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
