However, this is not the case. While the exact number of air marshals is classified information, it is estimated that there are only a limited number of them compared to the number of flights that take place on a daily basis. Air marshals are highly trained and undercover law enforcement officers who are responsible for ensuring the safety and security of passengers on board an aircraft.</p><p>Air marshals are deployed on flights based on a risk assessment conducted by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). They are typically placed on flights that are deemed to have a higher risk of a potential security threat.
