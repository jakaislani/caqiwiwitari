She created, produced and hosted a 1971 animal show called the Pet Set, which featured both wild animals and her celebrity friends’ own pets, with stars like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/doris-day data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Doris Day" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Doris Day</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/bob-barker data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bob Barker" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bob Barker</a> making guest appearances. She also wrote the 2011 book Betty & Friends: My Life at the Zoo and hosted specials, like Hero Dog Awards, Big Cat Week and Betty White Goes Wild — and even lent her voice to the animated series of Pound Puppies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But it’s what she did when the cameras weren't rolling that was most impressive. Throughout her life, White was a champion for animals in her charity work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I'm the luckiest person in the world — my life is divided in absolute half: half animals, half show business,” she told TV Guide.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">White's parents started her love of animals</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born in Oak Park, Illinois, on January 17, 1922, she was the only child of Horace and Tess White — who had an orange tabby cat that would often sit on the edge of her crib. “My mother always told me that if Toby didn’t approve, I would have to go back,” White joked to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://parade.com/53369/michelechollow/betty-white-dishes-on-her-love-of-animals/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Parade class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Parade</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Indeed, while most young kids were begging their parents for pets, White said it was often the opposite for her. “I was the lucky little girl who had parents who went for a walk and they'd come home with a dog or a cat,” she told TV Guide. “‘He followed us home, Betty. Can we keep him?’ [they’d say.]”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Both my mother and father were tremendous animal lovers,” she said to Smithsonian Magazine. “They imbued in me the fact that, to me, there isn’t an animal on the planet that I don’t find fascinating and want to learn more about.”</p><img alt="Betty White" title="Betty White" width=3000 height=2394 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-150018148.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images</span><p>Betty White with dogs Bandy, Stormy and Danny in 1954.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She's devoted much of her time to helping zoos</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That desire led to many trips to the zoo, and eventually, she started working with the Los Angeles Zoo in the 1960s. “My interest [in zoos] started early on, tagging after my mom and dad, who went to the zoo often, not just to please their little girl, but because they enjoyed the experience,” she wrote in her book.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I got involved with the Los Angeles Zoo because I was kind of shocked that Los Angeles had such a poor zoo inside,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/books/info-12-2011/betty-white-life-at-the-zoo-author-speaks.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=AARP class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">AARP</a>. “I've never been one to stand outside and criticize. I'd rather get inside and see what's going on, see how I can help.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During her time as a member of the board at the zoo, state-of-the-art chimpanzee, orangutan and gorilla exhibits were added, and she got to know the animals well. She also witnessed some notable animal antics over her more than 50 years of service.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I spent two hours watching while this baby [camel], newly born, tried to get up,” she told Smithsonian. “He really had to work at it. I stood there and watched the whole time. Just about the time he finally got all four legs under him...not his mother, but it was like Aunt Maude, one of the adult camels, came over, as if to say, ‘Oh, what a beautiful baby,’ she touched him with her nose and splat! Down he went. He had to start all over again.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">White was well aware of the critics of the zoo system and works to combat that negative image.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Zoos don't only exhibit animals; they do a lot of wonderful conservation work,” she told AARP. She explained further to Smithsonian: “Many people have a closed mind on zoos. They think no animal should be in captivity, they should all be in the wild in their own habitat. Well, of course, that is a myth.”</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Animal welfare and health are White's top focuses</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">White’s volunteer work went beyond just the zoo in Los Angeles. Starting in the 1970s, she also worked with the Morris Animal Foundation, which “advances animal health by funding only research that meets the highest scientific standards” according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org/core-values data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="their site" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">their site</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She was drawn to the organization because of her approach to animals. “I'm not into animal rights. I'm only into animal welfare and health,” she told TV Guide, adding that the Morris Animal Foundation funds “health studies for dogs, cats, lizards and wildlife.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a president emeritus, she saw the organization through much of its breakthrough work, which includes developing the feline leukemia vaccine, the parvovirus vaccine and Potomac horse fever vaccine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">White worked closely with the Los Angeles' SPCA (spcaLA), as well as the guide dog school, The Seeing Eye. “The Seeing Eye takes training these dogs quite seriously,” White told Parade. “By providing well-trained guide dogs and training recipients to work with these dogs, The Seeing Eye empowers and changes people’s lives for the better.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">White was also made an honorary forest ranger by the Forest Service and helped out whenever her schedule allowed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I have this very expensive habit,” she told Parade of her animal volunteer work. “Thankfully, my work makes it possible for me to support and volunteer my time with many different animal welfare organizations.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwrsStq7Jlp522tbGMmqWipZGhwG6vx5qpoqyp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
