When a fan stormed the stage in 2021 at a <a href=#>Maroon 5 concert</a>, people were not happy about Adam Levine's reaction.</p><p><a href=#>ET</a>&nbsp;reports the band was performing at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles at the We Can Survive concert. Levine was in the middle of singing "Sunday Morning" when a woman jumped on stage and began hugging the singer. Luis Pe√±aloza recorded a <a href=#>TikTok video</a>, clearly showing that Levine was not happy with the interaction. When the woman hugged Levine, he gave her a disgusting look before shouting, "F**k!" After security grabbed the woman, Levine literally shook off the hug in an annoyed mood. The video quickly went viral and garnered the attention of many people.</p><p>There were a lot of impassioned reactions to the interaction between the singer and the fan. One TikTok user wrote, "I get it, but he doesn't have to act disgusted by her. Like those are his fans that keep him relevant. Still a huge fan tho." While many argue that she shouldn't have gotten in his personal space. Another TikTok user wrote, "no this is not ok. yall say be humble, until that person pulls out a weapon. its happened before, and we need to remember and respect boundaries." The video of Levine amassed over a million views, and with that much attention, it reached the singer himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhnbIF1go6tn55ln6N6tMDAoJxmoZ6YtqWxza1ksKGknXqiecWapWaZlJa6brjEr6CnnV2drqV506hkmqifobyotdmeZJ%2BnomQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
