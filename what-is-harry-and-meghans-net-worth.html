Reportedly King Charles financially supported them and paid for their security after they settled in California.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>Both Markle and Harry became the subject of tabloid attention in July 2020 after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they purchased a $14.65 million luxurious property in Santa Barbara</a> surrounded by rose gardens, and including 16 bedrooms, a tea house, and a pool to raise their kids Archie and Lilibet.
