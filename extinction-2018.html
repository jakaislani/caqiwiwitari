Even more, there are alien soldiers, with bug-like sounds and green bubbles all over their bodies, that take their hunt to the streets and inside Peter's apartment building.&nbsp;</p><p>The main chunk of “Extinction,” then, becomes a full-on alien invasion and escape, full of alien baddies in big rubber suits shooting at human beings like it’s “<a href=#>The Purge</a>,” or spaceships blowing up apartment buildings in the distance&nbsp;like it’s “Skyline” all over again. Either way, it’s a B-movie with a blockbuster attitude, and not in a fun way. The effects are cheap but the action even more so, relying on the numbing spectacle of shoot-outs, while creating a scant&nbsp;sense of dread as Peter and his family try to escape their apartment building safely. In terms of production design creativity, it’s all a&nbsp;step down from the "'Mad Men' of the future" look that "Extinction" has for its pre-invasion costumes and apartment designs, one of its only inspired choices.&nbsp;</p><p>Thrills here come in nugget size: “Extinction” does provide Pena a lead action role to kick, punch, stab and shoot some aliens, injecting a wee bit of gusto into an otherwise very dour little story. Caplan, on the other hand, is given even less to work with, and their two young children who spend the whole time scream-crying (understandably so)&nbsp;even less than that. For fans of Netflix’s “Luke Cage,” <a href=#>Mike Colter</a> is also in this thing, but his presence might be the most baffling, and underutilized, of all. He’s just another actor trying to legitimize "Extinction," even though you can imagine these actors just shrugging at each other when they were done filming each day.&nbsp;</p><p>While the movie does feel like it’s going to be only a full-on alien invasion movie, it does reveal its other layers about an hour in. With respect to the filmmakers, including director <a href=#>Ben Young</a> ("<a href=#>Hounds of Love</a>") and screenwriters <a href=#>Spenser Cohen</a> and <a href=#>Brad Caleb Kane</a>,&nbsp;it doesn’t seem fair to discuss what that change is, even though it’s the reason this movie was likely so full-steam ahead on its cheesy concept (let’s just say that it refocuses the script with some timeliness). But just when you think the movie is about to get a little kooky, it only becomes quaint. One wishes that the movie went even further with its ideas, or tried to really discomfit viewers, but, no. Its strangest notion is that it's a family movie, if like with “<a href=#>Skyscraper</a>,” your family can stomach the constant&nbsp;imagery of lots of people being shot.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a tightness that I respect with “Extinction.” It’s not so much a thrill-ride but a movie monorail, with one revelation at the end meant to make us&nbsp;reconsider the entire journey. That speaks to its efficiency as the latest in mindless, if not&nbsp;attention-less Netflix movies. "Extinction"&nbsp;doesn’t seek to be much, but it’s just not all that charming, either.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46er62hnpjBqrvNZmlpaWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
