Of course, questions linger as to how it ran up a budget of $200 million, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but that’s probably a discussion best left for when it actually releases on October 6</a>.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>That being said, the recent press conference held after Killers of the Flower Moon screened at the Cannes Film Festival saw De Niro get a little sidetracked when he came to the conclusion it was the perfect time to wail on Donald Trump. He didn’t mention the Home Alone 2 star by name, but it certainly doesn’t take a genius to figure out who he was talking about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/killers-of-the-flower-moon.jpg><p>“I don’t understand a lot about my character.

After George Floyd with systemic racism – that’s what it is – what happens there; what we never knew of the Black Street Massacre, it’s the banality of evil. It’s the things to we have to watch out for. We see it today, we all know who I’m going to talk about – but that guy is stupid. Hale was smart in many ways, but it’s systemic.”</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>He did go on to name-drop the former reality TV host and WWE Hall of Famer eventually, but he didn’t have to for anyone who deigned to read between the lines. Is De Niro going to channel Trump for his performance in Killers of the Flower Moon? Who knows, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but if Mel Gibson is doing it in a John Wick prequel</a>, then it can’t be ruled out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqaialafBbrDEZqWiqp9isaavyJ2crGWgp7yuu9OipaBlm565rbHRrGSonl2ptaZ5xaWmsJ2iYrqwu81moKxlpJ2ybrXDnpilZaSeuqZ506hksJmZoXqwuoydpqeZnJl6tb7Upqdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
