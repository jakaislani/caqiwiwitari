While his career has been great, Iglesias' love life hasn't exactly been steady. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Iglesias is currently&nbsp;single, and&nbsp;the only person who came close&nbsp;to being his wife was his ex-girlfriend Claudia Valdez.&nbsp;</p><h2>Iglesias' Relationship with Valdez</h2><p>The American comedian and Valdez were in a long-term relationship. Valdez is an actress who made an&nbsp;appearance in the 2010&nbsp;horror sci-fi&nbsp;movie, Monsters.</p><p>The pair <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a>&nbsp;each other at&nbsp;an event of 'A Wish for Animals' held in January 2008 in Los Angeles, California. Valdez had&nbsp;a 10-year-old&nbsp;son, Frankie, from her previous relationship, but that didn't stop the duo from hitting it off. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Soon, the pair&nbsp;moved&nbsp;in together. Iglesias eventually adopted Valdez's son and became his bonus dad. They co-parented the Frankie and raised him together in California.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>More <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#MrIglesias</a> fun facts...</p><p>- Wilson High School looks exactly the same as when I attended in 1994.

His emotional issues led him to alcoholism, and that worsened the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>To cope with all the pressure and reform himself, Iglesias stepped down from his professional commitments while trying to kick his drinking habit. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>By the time he&nbsp;gained some control over his life, he had lost&nbsp;Valdez.</p><p>After over 12 years of staying together, the pair parted ways in July 2020. Although&nbsp;their separation was after The Fluffy Movie star's emotional turmoil, neither he nor his ex-girlfriend commented on the reason for their split.</p><p>Thankfully, the separation from his partner didn't sever Iglesias' relationship&nbsp;with his son. Instead, <a href=# rel=follow>the bond fortified as he promised to make reforms</a> for his sons. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While talking to People in 2020, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated </a>that being single again gave him a chance to focus on himself, his career, and his kid.</p><p><u><strong>You May Like:</strong></u>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Rob Delaney & Wife Pregnant Shortly After Losing Son To Cancer</a></p><h2>His Online Dating Experience&nbsp;</h2><p>It's no surprise that ace comedians like&nbsp;Iglesias can use their life experiences and turn them into funny jokes. They can also fictionalize scenes to make it sound like it was a part of their actual life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In one of his comedy skits&nbsp;shared on YouTube in April 2020, Iglesias&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">opened up</a>&nbsp;about his online dating experience. He revealed how he&nbsp;once mistakenly chatted to his sister, thinking she was someone else.</p><p>Asking all his audience to be extra careful while dating through the internet, he shared how a girl he thought was pretty&nbsp;was entirely different from her online profile.&nbsp;</p><p>Iglesias joked about how he once dated a woman who claimed she was Latina. But when he met&nbsp;her, he found out she was black. Disappointed,&nbsp;he asked the girl why she was lying.&nbsp;The girl got mad and said&nbsp;her&nbsp;name was Latina! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnl5avs7XEpWSin5yawKqt0makmqqinrKlecaiqaWeop6yr7CMsKCfnV6dwa64</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
