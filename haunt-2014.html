He wants to know what happened to his kids, a boy and two girls who died violently, one by one. But he ends up joining them when a demon sneaks up behind him and quickly seizes him, too.</p><p><a href=#>Jacki Weaver</a>, as the Morello family matriarch and the only one to get out of there alive, provides the back story in a lengthy, raspy voiceover: "After it started to happen, business dropped off," she says of her former career as a doctor. "After all, what good's a pediatrician who can't keep her own babies alive?"</p><p>But what do you know? Years later, another family moves into the house—the Ashers—which just happens to consist of a father, a mother, a boy and two girls. They're aware that horrible things happened to the previous residents but they're not worried, ostensibly because they've never seen a horror movie before.</p><p>Even the presence of Weaver's crazy-eyed character skulking around on moving day, searching for forgotten belongings, doesn't give them pause. She eerily informs 18-year-old Evan Asher (<a href=#>Harrison Gilbertson</a>) that the attic bedroom he's just claimed used to belong to her own 18-year-old son, Matthew. Evan reacts expressionlessly, as is his wont. In fact, no one here gets the benefit of characterization, so as things devolve from mildly frightening to legitimately threatening, it is impossible to care about who lives or dies. Even the obligatory youngest daughter, who spaces out from time to time and suggests that they make friends with the ghosts, doesn't register as an unsettling figure.</p><p>The true catalyst for the action here is Sam (<a href=#>Liana Liberato</a>), a cute but troubled neighbor girl who knows the history of the home and even knows the nooks and crannies where noteworthy items are hidden. (Her connection to the house is pretty clear, pretty quickly.) The daughter of an alcoholic and abusive single dad, Sam seeks shelter with the Ashers—specifically, with Evan, in his bed. Soon they dig up the rickety, wooden box, and they're summoning spirits, and the spiral of cliché calamity begins anew.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46hmK6mpGJ%2FcX2T</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
