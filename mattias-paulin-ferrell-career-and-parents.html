The comedian is often amazed by the way his boys perceive the world. Furthermore, it appears that Will’s children have been carrying on the traditions of their elders.</p><p>In a 2018 interview with PARADE magazine, Will talked candidly about parenting and how his children share his sense of humor. He said, “Yes, my sons have some of the same comedic DNA,” to the reporter’s question.</p><p>They each have a sense of humor. My high school freshman is incredibly subtle in his humor. He had borrowed another child’s glasses for his yearbook photo the previous year. He is not a spectacle wearer.</p><p>There he is, wearing spectacles and wearing a really serious expression. That’s hilarious and subversive, just like Magnus. That’s exactly my comedy. Am I in trouble? he asks. Like, “No, you have to do it annually!” Wonderful!</p><h2><span id=Mattias_Paulin_Ferrell8217s_and_his_brothers_find_their_dad8217s_SNL_antics_embarrassing>Mattias Paulin Ferrell’s and his brothers find their dad’s SNL antics embarrassing.</span></h2><p>As everyone knows, Will rose to fame as a Saturday Night Live cast member.
