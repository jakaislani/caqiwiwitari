The bacon surprised us because we don't associate meat with elves. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.enworld.org/attachments/gs3-jpg.136200/ data-url data-zoom-target=1 alt=GS3.jpg title=GS3.jpg width=640 height=480 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Not Just Vegetables​</h3><a href=# class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><b>Heroes' Feast</b></a> says a lot about elven cuisine by what it doesn't include. Of the elven recipes in <a href=# class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><b>Heroes' Feast</b></a><b>, </b>two involve seafood (shrimp and Dragon Salmon), one involves eggs, and only one involves meat: Greenspear Bundles in Bacon. Why was it included? Because it's actually made by half-elves:<br><p>Greenspears, also referred to as asparagus or "sparrow grass" by humans, is a perennial flower plant that has ascended to staple-status in many elven diets. While elves consume greenspear raw, seasoned, roasted, or steamed with herbs, their half-elf brethren--liberated from certain culinary taboos--have developed an additional preparation technique. In an irreverent touch, but one that flavorfully complements the greenspear, half-elves add salted and cured pork into the mix, in deference to their half-human taste buds. Regarding bacon, the thicker cut is always the better!"</p>This is the first meal we served with guests and they found it surprisingly delicious. It's the sort of meal that's different enough to introduce as an appetizer but flavorful enough that it gets eaten quickly. I'm not fond of asparagus or bacon, but the combination is delicious.<p>It's also a meal you can feasibly make for your players with a very short baking time (15 minutes or longer if you prefer your bacon crispier).</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.enworld.org/attachments/gs1-jpg.136199/ data-url data-zoom-target=1 alt=GS1.jpg title=GS1.jpg width=640 height=480 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Tolkien's Elves​</h3>The association of elves with vegetarianism is likely due to their affinity with nature, established in J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. There's much discussion of elven lembas, a kind of travel ration, but little else. The association with elves avoiding meat likely stems from the inspiration for wood elves, the Green Elves of Ossiriand, who decided that men as "<a href=# class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">hewers of trees and hunters of beasts</a>" were no friends of theirs.<p>Still, there is enough evidence throughout Tolkien's works to indicate that meat was present when elves served a meal or when they ate at a table, and the fact it wasn't mentioned that an elf skipped the meat portion of the meal argues that they were not vegetarian.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.enworld.org/attachments/gs2-jpg.136198/ data-url data-zoom-target=1 alt=GS2.jpg title=GS2.jpg width=640 height=480 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>D&D Elves​</h3>But what of elves in <b>Dungeons & Dragons? </b>Here's what <a href=# class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><b>Heroes' Feast</b></a> has to say on the subject:<br><p>Because they place such a strong value on life, a high percentage of elves stringently exercise food restrictions, and a great many would fall into the category of vegetarian, vegan, or pescatarian--little that bleeds ends up on elven plates.</p>Ironically, D&D wood elves seem to be different from their Tolkien-inspired brethren:<br><p>High elves tend to align their diets most closely to their values, and prefer fruits, vegetables, and grains to meat and poultry. By contrast, wood elves are often wanderers and adventures and, consequently, more disposed to hunting and foraging.</p>So it seems that at least some elves eat meat after all.
