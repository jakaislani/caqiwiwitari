Carleton left home at 15 to work on the stage and received her first break when the impresario C. B. Cochran promoted her from the chorus to a role in his 1914 <a class=tronLink href=#>revue</a> <i>Watch your Step</i>. According to Cochran, despite having a weak voice, Carleton had a good stage presence, and her delicate beauty charmed the audience. When he was informed during the run of the show that Carleton was attending opium parties, Cochran fired her. He gave her another chance in 1917, when she took over the leading role from <a class=tronLink href=#>Gertie Millar</a> in his show <i>Houp La!</i> She made little impression in the part, which she took on only a week before the show closed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/billie-carleton-d0d5730f-c46f-45b1-94f2-e1cb7647dc3-resize-750.jpeg><p>Carleton was soon appearing for <a class=tronLink href=#>André Charlot</a> in another revue, <i>Some More Samples!</i> Although the critics again noted her weak voice, she had better success in this, and was engaged for the part of Joy Chatterton, a <a class=tronLink href=#>flapper</a> in the hit musical farce <i><a class=tronLink href=#>The Boy</a></i> when it opened at the <a class=tronLink href=#>Adelphi Theatre</a> in August 1917. In May 1918 she appeared in <i>Fair and Warmer</i>, this time playing a maid to <a class=tronLink href=#>Fay Compton</a>'s flapper. Then in August she took the star part of Phyllis Harcourt in <i>The Freedom of the Seas</i> at the Haymarket Theatre, briefly becoming the youngest leading lady in the <a class=tronLink href=#>West End</a>.</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Death-and-scandal>Death and scandal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/billie-carleton-2d8c9e3c-9821-4a6c-a151-bb43c4da9d9-resize-750.jpeg><p>On 27 November 1918 she left the theatre after performing and, wearing a daringly diaphanous outfit designed by her friend Reggie de Veulle, attended the Victory Ball at the <a class=tronLink href=#>Royal Albert Hall</a>. It was one of many such events held to commemorate the recent end of the war, but being under the patronage of a large number of aristocratic ladies, it was a particularly long and splendid affair, lasting into the small hours. The next day Carleton's maid found her dead in bed in her <a class=tronLink href=#>Savoy Hotel</a> suite, apparently killed by an overdose of cocaine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/billie-carleton-ddce4dae-8452-4395-b57a-ed9808c90ee-resize-750.jpeg><p>A coroner's inquest found that Carleton had died of a cocaine overdose "supplied to her by Reginald de Veulle in a culpable and negligent manner". De Veulle was charged with manslaughter and conspiracy to supply a prohibited drug under Regulation 40b of the <a class=tronLink href=#>Defence of the Realm Act 1914</a>, which had been passed in 1916 and made possession of both cocaine and opium illegal for the first time in Britain. The trial was held before Mr Justice Salter, with Sir Richard Muir for the prosecution. De Veulle was acquitted of the first charge but pleaded guilty to the second, and was sentenced to eight months in prison.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/billie-carleton-8138d1c0-cbfa-45a6-93bf-35203996b08-resize-750.jpeg><p>Reports of the trial exposed details of Carleton's private life and those of her friends, particularly de Veulle, who had previously been involved in a homosexual blackmail case and had dressed in women's clothes. Although the milieu in which she moved was stigmatised as immoral and sordid, and although she had been the kept mistress of a man twenty years her senior, Carleton herself was seen largely as an innocent victim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/billie-carleton-4300b35a-5a7c-46da-b673-8b0003fb4ec-resize-750.jpeg><p>Ada Song Ping You was a Scotswoman who had married a Chinese man (Song Ping You) from whom she learned to use opium. After Carleton's death, You was sentenced to five months in jail with hard labour for preparing opium for smoking and supplying it to Carleton. The author <a class=tronLink href=#>Marek Kohn</a>, however, argues that Carleton did not die from cocaine but from legal depressants taken to deal with her cocaine hangover.</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=In-art-and-literature>In art and literature</h2><p><a class=tronLink href=#>Noël Coward</a>, who had known both Carleton and de Veulle, acknowledged her story as a source for his first successful play, <i><a class=tronLink href=#>The Vortex</a></i>.
