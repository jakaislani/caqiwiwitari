So when you open the juice bottle or jar and don’t <b>refrigerate</b> juice after opening, it will start fermenting over time and reduce the juice shelf life. It’s due to a bacterial attack on juice.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-juice-be-refrigerated-after-opening></span>Should juice be refrigerated after opening?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The fridge also retards deterioration of the flavor, color, and texture of many foods. The vast majority of fruit and vegetable juices sold in the United States are pasteurized to eliminate potentially harmful bacteria during the manufacturing process, according to the FDA.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-apple-juice-go-bad-if-not-refrigerated></span>Does apple juice go bad if not refrigerated?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Once again, let’s start with the apple juice sold unrefrigerated. Such juice usually comes with a best-by date, which informs you how long the liquid should retain its freshness. That’s a fairly conservative estimate, and the juice in an <b>unopened container will last at least a few months longer</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-can-unopened-orange-juice-go-unrefrigerated></span>How long can unopened orange juice go unrefrigerated?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>about 12 to 18 months Properly stored, unopened orange juice that has been sold unrefrigerated will generally stay at best quality for <b>about 12 to 18 months</b> when stored at room temperature, although it will usually remain safe to drink after that.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-if-you-drink-juice-thats-been-left-out></span>What happens if you drink juice thats been left out?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>That said, unrefrigerated OJ will spoil after more than a few hours and probably won’t taste great. As it sits on the counter at room temp, <b>fermentation sets in</b>, producing lactic acid organisms that give off a funky flavor and destroy the shelf life of the juice.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-juicy-juice-need-to-be-refrigerated></span>Does Juicy Juice need to be refrigerated?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Opened products should always be kept in a sealed container in the refrigerator to ensure maximum freshness.

According to the FDA leaving perishable foods, such as orange juice, sitting at room temperature for <b>two hours or more</b> will allow bacteria to grow.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-does-fresh-orange-juice-last-out-of-the-fridge></span>How long does fresh orange juice last out of the fridge?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>How Long Does Orange Juice Last<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th>Fridge</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Orange juice sold unrefrigerated (unopened)</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Orange juice sold unrefrigerated (opened)</td><td><b>7 – 10 days</b></td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Orange juice sold refrigerated (unopened)</td><td>Use-by + 3 – 5 days</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Orange juice sold refrigerated (opened)</td><td>7 days</td></tr></tbody></table>• May 17, 2021<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-drink-juice-left-out-overnight></span>Can you drink juice left out overnight?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>According to the US Food and medicine Administration, perishable foods that are supposed to be refrigerated, like juice, <b>can only be left out at room temperature for two hours</b> before it’s considered unsafe to consume. … But really, it’s just good practice to keep your juice in the fridge at all times, unpasteurized or not.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-juice-go-bad></span>Does juice go bad?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Unopened juice has a shelf-life of 12 months.
