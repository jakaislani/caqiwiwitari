Zijie held a married status.</p><p>It doesn’t appear that Zijie’s wife is the type of person who enjoys publicity and the media.</p><p>She must be in excruciating pain following the untimely death of her spouse.</p><p>Zijies’ wife comes out as a reserved person who seems to dislike the spotlight and the intrusive world of media attention.</p><p>She must be going through a great deal of grief at her husband’s sudden death.</p><p>There is no doubt that she is in excruciating pain.
