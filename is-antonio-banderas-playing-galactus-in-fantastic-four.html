After the group‚Äôs disastrous reboot in 2015, it‚Äôs safe to say fans couldn‚Äôt want anything more than for Kevin Feige to get his hands on <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> and bring them to the MCU.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>We got a taste of this in Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness as John Krasinski brought Mr. Fantastic to life. But, fans are desperate for the team to get another proper film. Back during the announcement of Phase 4 in July 2019, Feige revealed that there was a new Fantastic Four film in development. As of writing this, the film is slated for release on Feb. 14, 2025, though between the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, it‚Äôs expected the film will be delayed.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>Since the announcement of Fantastic Four, fans have been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dream-casting</a> the iconic Marvel team and its villainous lineup. However, many Marvel fanatics have been reporting on rumors regarding Fantastic Four, including The Legend of Zorro star himself <strong>Antonio Banderas </strong>possibly joining the team in a sinister way.</p><h2 id=h-antonio-banderas-mcu-debut data-injectable=false>Antonio Banderas‚Äô MCU debut?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Marvel‚Äôs Fantastic Four Updates:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Vanessa Kirby is Sue Storm<br>‚Ä¢ Joseph Quinn is Johnny Storm<br>‚Ä¢ Ebon Moss-Bachrach has been cast<br>‚Ä¢ Galactus will be the main villain<br>‚Ä¢ Antonio Banderas was offered Galactus a few months ago. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4MsJZmYb5T</a></p>‚Äî Matt Ramos (@therealsupes) <a href=#>August 3, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>Baneras is rumored to be playing the big bad Galactus in the upcoming Fantastic Four. Considering Banderas just graced the screen a few years ago as Uncharted‚Äòs villain, he would be no stranger to turning to the dark side. Plus, Banderas is one of the few actors in Hollywood not sucked into the MCU as of yet, so it would be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a great role</a> to get him into entertainment conglomerate.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=790 data-injectable=true>For those unfamiliar with the character, Galactus is a cosmic supergiant who has to consume planets to continue to live. He does technically appear in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, though not in any form you would recognize. Instead, he appears almost like an evil hurricane, descending onto the Earth. Otherwise, Fantastic Four would mark the first film appearance of the classic villain.</p><h2 id=h-molding-for-what data-injectable=false>Molding for what?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=es dir=ltr>Aqui estoy en el extra√±o, y un poquito agobiante, proceso de construir una replica exacta de mi rostro para una pelicula‚Ä¶de la que ya os informar√© mas adelante.</p><p>üëâ Here I am in the strange and a little exhausting process of building an exact copy of my face for a movie‚Ä¶ üîú <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NWcakPeXFr</a></p>‚Äî Antonio Banderas (@antoniobanderas) <a href=#>May 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>Multiple actors are being tied to Fantastic Four as of late, but very few have any genuine evidence to support it. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Quaid</a> has even gone on record to dispute the rumor he‚Äôll be playing Johnny Storm. However, eagle-eyed fans have been sharing a tweet by Banderas from May that implies he‚Äôs working on a big upcoming project, implying the project is in fact Fantastic Four.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>In the video, makeup artists apply putty to Banderas to create an accurate mold of his face. He captioned the video saying they were ‚Äúbuilding an exact copy of my face for a movie‚Äù though the movie goes unnamed. While this process can be used to create a number of costume pieces, Marvel fans think this mold is being used to create a version of Galactus‚Äô helmet for Banderas to wear.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=false>The Puss in Boots actor has yet to publicly comment on the rumors, and the project that he got the mold for has not been disclosed at this time. A variety of other crazy projects are in progress in Hollywood right now, so these mold-related Galactus rumors remain, for the time being, as rumors. Plus, with the SAG-AFTRA strike <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">still in full swing</a>, it‚Äôs highly unlikely any casting news will be released in the near future regarding Fantastic Four.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlkaPBsLrIqGSbmZ6ZsrOt0manpZmpnruoecaao5qbpKrAbrXNZp2apqSWwLW1wmadqK2iZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
