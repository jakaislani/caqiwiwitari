He famously starts most of his videos with the line “people are mad at [insert celebrity, TikToker, influencer, etc…]” and captions those videos with “what do yall think?”</p><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=true>The video that apparently didn’t land him in Rae’s good graces is the one in which he comments on Rae’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">holy trinity bikini scandal</a>. He posted three back-to-back videos of the situation, scoring a combined eight million views in total. In Rae’s scandalous photo, she can be seen wearing an all-white bikini with the words “father” and “son” printed on the right and left top pieces. The zinger was that the bikini also had the word “holy spirit” printed on the bottom piece.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@noahglenncarter href=#>@noahglenncarter</a><p>What do yall think <a title=addisonrae href=#>#addisonrae</a> <a title=foryo href=#>#foryo</a> <a title=christian href=#>#christian</a></p><a title="♬ Paris - 斌杨Remix" href=#>♬ Paris – 斌杨Remix</a></figure><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>Neither TikTok nor the public at large took kindly to Rae’s apparent disrespect to the Christian faith, and the 21-year-old TikTok star immediately took the post down from Instagram. The holy trinity bikini was created in collaboration with Adidas, according to <a href=#>Page Six</a>.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Adidas, however, was quick to clarify that their “partnership with Praying is specific to the limited release of a Supernova Cushion 7 shoe,” according to a <a href=#>quote</a> obtained by NBC news.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Rae has yet to comment on the situation, nor has she addressed the removal of the picture.&nbsp;Carter was quick to point this out in a subsequent video that earned him almost two million views.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true><a title=@noahglenncarter href=#>@noahglenncarter</a><p>What do yalm think <a title=addisonrae href=#>#addisonrae</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a></p><a title="♬ Chill Vibes - Tollan Kim" href=#>♬ Chill Vibes – Tollan Kim</a></figure><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false>Rae apparently had enough of Carter’s commentary and quickly blocked him from TikTok.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false><a title=@noahglenncarter href=#>@noahglenncarter</a><p>Oh well <a title=addisonrae href=#>#addisonrae</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - NoahGlennCarter" href=#>♬ original sound – NoahGlennCarter</a></figure><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>Carter addressed being blocked by Rae in an additional Tik Tok video. He clarified that Rae did not delete her TikTok as he previously assumed, but instead blocked him. The video raked in another five million views for Carter.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>In a surprising turn of events, a week after the scandal Carter informed his TikTok followers that not only was he blocked from seeing Rae’s TikTok account, but that Rae’s mom, Sheri Nicole Easterling, started following him. Carter captioned the video “What is going on.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true><a title=@noahglenncarter href=#>@noahglenncarter</a><p>What is going on <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - 👁👄👁" href=#>♬ original sound – 👁👄👁</a></figure><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>In the comments section of Carter’s video, Easterling responded by saying, “What. I followed you bc (because) it said you followed me.” To which Carter replied, “Oh ok! I’ve been following you for like a year so I thought there was something more to it.”</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>No one other than Rae and her mother can explain why she started following the content creator Rae so intentionally blocked. Then again, the mother-daughter-duo might not be on the best footing after news broke Rae unfollowed Easterling on Instagram, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a> to Page Six.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>This comes following the alleged affair between Rae’s father, Monty Lopez, and a 25-year-old woman, to which Noah Glenn Carter naturally commented on in the video below, no doubt contributing to Rae’s decision to block him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=537 data-injectable=false><a title=@noahglenncarter href=#>@noahglenncarter</a><p>What do yall think <a title=addisonrae href=#>#addisonrae</a> <a title=montylopez href=#>#montylopez</a> <a title=yunggravy href=#>#yunggravy</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a></p><a title="♬ Chill Vibes - Tollan Kim" href=#>♬ Chill Vibes – Tollan Kim</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTYZpuinF2WsaW10qilZqqRmnqjuM6comamn5a1brPLnqWnZZOWv7Wx0Wamp2Wknri1u8po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
